## =================== .lightning/config ================= ##
## For more information on how to configure this file, see:
## https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/doc/lightningd-config.5.md

## Sets the network we are running.
network=regtest

## Sets the working directory.
lightning-dir=/data/lightning

## Sets the logfile path.
log-file=/var/log/lightning/lightningd.log

## Location of the wallet file.
#wallet=sqlite3:///data/lightning/wallet.sqlite3:/data/backup/wallet.sqlite3

## Up to 32 bytes of UTF-8 characters to tag your node. Anyone can call their 
## node anything they want. The default is an NSA-style codename derived from 
## your public key.
#alias=SILENTPENGUIN

## Your favorite color as a hex code.
#rgb=024c1e

## Set an IP address (v4 or v6) or automatic Tor address to listen on and (maybe) 
## announce as our node address.
#addr=autotor

## Set an IP address or UNIX domain socket to listen to, but do not announce. 
## A UNIX domain socket is distinguished from an IP address by beginning with a /
#bind-addr=/var/run/lightning.sock

## Set an IP (v4 or v6) address or Tor address to announce. A Tor address is 
## distinguished by ending in .onion. PORT defaults to 9735.
#announce-addr=ANNOUNCE_ONION.onion:9375

## Always use the proxy, even to connect to normal IP addresses (you can still 
## connect to Unix domain sockets manually). This also disables all DNS lookups, 
## to avoid leaking information.
#always-use-proxy=true
